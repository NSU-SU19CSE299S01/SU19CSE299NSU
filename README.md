Ex-convict. But since my friend Tommy had recently been released after doing 32 years for murder, I’m thinking he qualifies.

Fifteen months earlier I’d been invited to speak to a writers group at Green Haven, a maximum security prison in New York. I’d gotten an email from the prison librarian. When I asked her why she picked me, she said, “I didn’t. They picked you.”

‘They’ were 22 men — all aspiring writers — all with plenty of years left to practice their craft. I accepted the invitation.

That was the easy part. The hard part was scheduling a date. The state of New York has stringent rules about who they let in to teach a class. ‘Bestselling author’ doesn’t cut it. They do a serious background check.

I filled out the forms, waited months to hear from them, and was finally told there were more forms to fill out. I’m sure the librarian and the state had other things to do, and the time dragged on. A year passed. Finally, she scheduled a date.

As the big day approached, I panicked. I’m comfortable speaking to a group, but before I do I make sure I understand the mindset of my target audience. I knew nothing about prison life. I had no clue how to talk to these men.

I called Tommy. “What do I do? What do I say to them?”

“Just be yourself,” he said.

“What does that mean? I’m a privileged white guy who has never even seen the inside of a traffic court. They’re not going to be impressed with my rap sheet.”

“They don’t care about that. They only care about how you relate to them. You’re funny, you’re irreverent, don’t tiptoe around them. Treat them like you’d treat anyone else. Just be yourself. They’ll love you.”

I wasn’t sure it was great advice, because sometimes being myself can fall flat, and I leave a lasting first impression — what an asshole. But I decided to trust Tommy.

The next day I drove to Green Haven. I was scanned, searched, vetted, and escorted through a series of locked doors. Finally, the librarian brought me into the library. Chairs were set up in a circle, and I sat at the front.

Minutes later my writers group filed in. A few smiled, but most of their expressions ranged from non-committal to leery to ominous.

I stood up. “First of all,” I said, “thanks for inviting me. That was a year ago January. Sorry it took me 15 months to get here, but there were so many forms to fill out, so many hoops to jump through, so much red tape to cut.” Pause, and then… “Do you guys have any idea how fucking hard it is to get into this place?”

That broke the ice. They howled. Their body language changed, and they relaxed in their seats.

“What’s so funny?” I said.

“You’re not what we expected,” one of them yelled.

“What did you expect?” I asked him.

“Some guy with a broom up his ass.”

“Son of a bitch,” I said. “I had one. But the guards confiscated it as soon as I walked through the gate.”

More laughs. No more ominous looks. That cemented it. Tommy had been right. All I had to do was be my typical asshole self, and I’d connected.

And the next two and a half hours turned out to be one of the most rewarding, fulfilling, memorable times of my life.
