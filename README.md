The only really bad voting advice is not to vote, that your vote doesn’t count, or to ignore voter suppression.

Every vote matters, should be cast if you care what happens to you (and the nation and the world), and should not be obstructed. We’ve seen elections come down to a single vote this year: it’s just a documentable fact at this point. If you don’t understand this, it’s time.

If you do understand and care about what happens to you and your vote, you should advocate for everyone’s vote just like you do yours: just because it’s not your vote being suppressed today doesn’t mean it might not be later.

If you really understand how important this is to your future, do you want that possibility out there?

This is called a slippery slope. It may not happen. But it could. Either way, you should care about voter suppression. That’s what’s ethical.

Your vote is yours. Cast it and cast it how you want. But remember that just like with voting, that your situation can hypothetically and maybe actually change in a moment.

So perhaps remember when you cast your vote, that you could be any person anywhere in the world impacted by your vote that you are casting.

Stranger circumstances have happened to real people.

Weigh what’s ethical to you and what you personally could live with as a gamble.

And vote.
